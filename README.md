This project presents a Ride Sharing System designed and implemented as part of the Database Systems course at Punjab University College of Information Technology (PUCIT). The system provides a structured and efficient database solution for managing ride-hailing operations. It covers all core entities involved in a ride-sharing platform, including customers, drivers, vehicles, locations, routes, rides, payments, ratings, and complaints.
The project follows a complete database development lifecycle, starting from Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and Relational Model to schema design, table creation, and data insertion using SQL. Advanced database concepts such as views, PL/SQL functions, procedures, and triggers are implemented to ensure data integrity, automation, and business rule enforcement. The system also supports common reports for ride tracking, payments, complaints, and driver performance. Overall, this project demonstrates practical application of relational database concepts in a real-world scenario.
